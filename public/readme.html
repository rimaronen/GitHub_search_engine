this program simulates github search engine. the search engine is a protected page - will work only if session is open.
the program uses sqlite3 database to keep favorite saved list.

the session in the program is defined for 2 minutes. may change the time in maxAge in app.js

1. short description for each ajax call in the program:

        case field, and delete if so
    c. method: 'DELETE'
    d. params: req.body.name (when the name is converted to lower case)
    e. returns: object with message for successful deleting to the database

#ajax call for check session:

    b. description: called from the client when search request appears
    c. method: 'POST'
    d. params: session request
    e. returns: object with matching message if the session exists or not

# ajax call for searching a user:

    b. ajax parameters: method: 'GET'
    c. relevant response content: "login", "repos_url", "public_repos", "followers_url", "follower".

# ajax call for searching user's followers list:

    b. ajax parameters: method: 'GET'
    c. relevant response content: "html_url", "full_name" (of the repository)

2. for an optimal flow in the program, all fetch request are executed in async function.
each fetch in executed by definition as async function, so that the rest of the program continues
the flow without any interruptions.
by checking the response status from fetch, new promise is returned, as rejected of resolved.

3. the program REST service:
the program REST service contains User database of type sqlite3 - for creating new users for the saved list,
for the saved users and delete the routes above handle.


note: we were requested to find followers number and repositories number for each user- but the fetch api
was returned with at most 30 of each. so the program runs on the parsed array length that was returned from the request.
